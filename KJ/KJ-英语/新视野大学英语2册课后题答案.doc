The formation and development of the Chinese calligraphy is closely related to the emergence and evolution of Chinese characters. In this long evolutionary process,Chinese characters have not only played an important role in exchanging ideas and transmitting culture but also developed into a unique art form.Calligraphic works well reflect calligraphers’ personal feeling, knowledge, self-cultivation, personality, and so forth, thus there is an expression that “seeing the calligraphers’ handwriting is like seeing the person”. As one of the treasures of Chinese culture, Chinese calligraphy shines splendidly in the world’s treasure house of culture and art. <br>Section B <br>4.words in use <br>1.mysterious   2.desperate   3.devise   4.negotiate            5.recalled   6.specifically    7.depict   8.ignorance 9.expand    10.confusion 5.Expressions in use <br>1.apply to  2.in a bid to  3.end up  4.Speaking of  5.get hold of 6.appealed to  7.Leaving  behind  8.focus on 6.Sentence structure <br>1.Even though it is important for the students to have a deep understanding of the texts,it doesn’t make any sense to read texts word for word from the beginning to the end. <br>2.As it is a matter of little importance to us,it doesn’t make much sense to argue out which is wrong or which is better or worse. <br>3.It makes no sense to compel children to obey their parents;instead, we should try to tell them what is right and what is wrong. 7. <br>1.If l had known it was so hot yesterday,l might as well have stay at home. <br>2.Since we waited for so many hours at the airport lat night,we might as well have taken the train home. 3.I already knew the secret,so he might as well have told me all about it.

Many universities have set up their own digital learning platforms, and digital teaching is playing an increasingly important role in education.

The government stresses improvement of its people’s livelihood, striving to improve their economic conditions and meet their growing material and cultural needs. Currently, the Chinese government advocates the unleashing of more reform dividends with the aim of offering more real benefits to its people.

Embroidery, with at least two or three thousand years of history, is one of the Chinese traditional folk arts and crafts. Since most embroiderers are women, it’s also called “women’s needlework”. Embroidery has been much-loved by the Chinese people. It can be used to beautify clothing and things. For example, clothes, quilts, pillowcases etc. can be embroidered with beautiful designs, or a piece of embroidery can be made for a special ornament. There are four most famous types of embroidery in China: Suxiu from Suzhou, Yuexiu from Guangdong, Xiangxiu from Hunan, and Shuxiu from Sichuan, each having its own style and theme. Among the four, Suzhou embroidery has enjoyed the highest reputation.    <br>Section B <br>Language focus 4.Words in use  <br>1.bounced    2.tolerate   3.supplement   4.condemn   5.overflowed    6.swear  7.resemble   8.compounded   9.disgusting   10.trim <br> <br>5.Expressions in use  <br>1.convert to   2.was revolted by   3.was comprised of   4.busied himself with 5.fussed over   6.is unique in   7.exerting themselves   8.substituted for  6.Sentence structure  <br>1.Having no idea about their thoughts and opinions, I would rather give up the attempt to guess what <br>their reaction will be. <br>2.To avoid making mistakes, I would rather be home alone and not communicate with anybody. 3.The old man would rather be living in the past, for things are much more different today than they <br>were in the past.  <br> 7.  <br>1.I couldn’t stand bad manners and thought my leaving was anything but rude, so I got the next train <br>back home and left him there. <br>2.They usually look very nice and even generous, but in terms of integrity, they are anything but <br>honest. <br>3.When the two young people got married, many people attended the wedding ceremony, yet it was <br>anything but modern.
